# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-with-Python

This repository demonstrates several projects and the complete workflow of data science and machine learning using Python. It covers data handling, cleaning, visualization, modeling, and NLP techniques on raw datasets (Excel/CSV files).

(🚀 Key Features
	•	Data Analysis – Explore datasets and extract insights.
	•	Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
	•	Data Visualization – Create meaningful plots and graphs for better understanding.
	•	Data Modeling (Classification) – Build and evaluate classification models.
	•	Dataset Splitting (Train/Test) – Prepare data for machine learning workflows.
	•	Feature Scaling – Standardize and normalize features for better performance.
	•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Text preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment/feature extraction.
	•	Raw Dataset Handling – Work directly with Excel (CSV files).

(🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Python: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK / spaCy
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Excel / CSV datasets
